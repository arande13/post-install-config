Help topics were configured to prepare for the mock ticket scenario. Help topics (Business Critical Outage, Personal Computer Issues, Password Reset, and Equipment Request) were created to reflect real life scenarios that an agent will encounter in the help desk landscape.

Agents roles have been configured to allow or restrict their access based off rank in the mock OSTicket. The varying levels (Supreme Admin, Expanded Access, and Limited Access) have been added to differentiate what an agent can do in regards to modifying a ticket, working, and ultimatelty resolving/closing the ticket.

The agent users, Jane and John Doe, have been created as mock agents that have logins. They serve the purpose of allowing me to login from the agent perspective to work tickets created by the my admin login labuser1.
